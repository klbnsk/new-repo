When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (to watch our life together)
You just like going to Heaven (my heart)
Oh, your vanity
I'm fallin', and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' me
One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes
Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' on FaceTime
Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Late from the country cadence
No peacemaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer (huh)
I need no beef, no cheese (yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (uh)
Every time we meet, na√Øve
When I stare in your eyes
Still be there forever
To watch our life (to watch out life together)
You just like going to Heav- (my heart)
One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)
Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
It's mad how I gets so hot
It's mad how you get me by (by)
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's-
